# BlackjackProject

# Description
This project is a simple game of Blackjack. The user is welcomed to the Blackjack table at which time he is told to press enter to start the game. The game starts as expected; the dealer deals two cards to the player and reveals only one of the cards dealt to their hand. The player is then asked if they want to hit or stay and the appropriate scenario follows. Each move in the game, the player controls the pace by having to hit enter to reveal the next card. Starting with the first four cards dealt, the program is always checking if either player hits 21 or busts.

The Blackjack application itself exists within its own class, while a large amount of the Blackjack logic/behavior portion program lives in a class called BlackjackDealer and another called BlackjackHand. These classes call on Card related classes to shuffle the deck and deal the cards. The Blackjack Dealer is responsible for distributing the cards to the player's hand a well as evaluating who won the game.

# Technologies Used
Eclipse, Git, Terminal

# What I learned
This one was a test of how well I could organize my code and track logic paths. Same as last week, this program would have been a lot more challening without an accurate UML diagram. As far as things I learned, this was the first time I used Enums so that was the biggest takeaway - a practical application of a newly learned concept.
